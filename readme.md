## Exploratory Data Analysis 
- I have created my own dataset using **web scraping** on Top 100 anime tv shows and movies with the help of beautifulsoup and requests.
- It contains the following columns- ```Name, Links, Genre and Theme, No. of episodes, Rating```
- Also implemented Exploratory Data Analysis on the same using matplotlib and seaborn.
